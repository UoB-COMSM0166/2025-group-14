Feedback after demo'ing paper prototype and first working prototype of canal/movable player/autonomous pursuer (workshop session 06/02/2025):

## I really like:

- Endless loop map
- Vector mechanics on the chaser

## I was confused about:

- Understanding the lock system

## One thing I suggest to improve is:

- Having a point system to get power-ups from the chandlery
- Potential improvements to canal boat purchasable at the chandlery?
- Potentially basing maps on real canal systems?
- Lock mechanics - is water level change triggered by a player input (key-mashing/moving over an icon?) or does it occur at a pre-defined rate automatically? Should the rate of water level change be constant/vary across different locks/incorporate a random element?
