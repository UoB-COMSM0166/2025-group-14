Feedback after demo'ing paper prototype and first working prototype of canal/movable player/autonomous pursuer:

## I really like:

- Endless loop map
- Vector mechanics on the chaser

## I was confused about:

- Understanding the lock system

## One thing I suggest to improve is:

- Having a point system to get power-ups from the chandlery
- Potential improvements to canal boat purchasable at the chandlery?
