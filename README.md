## Game ideas

### Idea 1: Canal chase game
Top down lightly humorous chase game where you, on a canalboat, must flee a pursuing canalboat, across a top-down map. In addition to dodging your pursuer’s AI, you must master such mechanics as: rounding tight corners (ideally overcoming some very basic physics challenges; this is a secondary priority to AI pursuit mechanics), filling and emptying locks (can slow you or your pursuers down depending on how you time them), canal economics (keep yourself refuelled at chandleries as you pass them) and staying on top of repairs (your boat will need fixing every so often. Either stop and deal with repairs as they come, or keep going forwards until they build up and bring you to a complete halt). 

### Idea 2: Robot Platformer
Platformer style game where you are an Android in the year 2442. An evil conglomerate has stolen parts from you and your mission is to get these back before it's too late and you become obsolete. Along the way you have to go through levels and solve small puzzles and problems to progress. Problems to deal with include lasers, trap doors, and traps. The tools at your disposal include jet packs, teleportation and hacking. These are upgrades that you get as you find the parts and progress through the levels.
