## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel?

#### Game ideas

##### Idea 1: Canal chase game
[Paper Prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piU6QgTMxiM)

Top down lightly humorous chase game where you, on a canalboat, must flee a pursuing canalboat, across a top-down map. In addition to dodging your pursuerâ€™s AI, you must master such mechanics as: rounding tight corners (ideally overcoming some very basic physics challenges; this is a secondary priority to AI pursuit mechanics), filling and emptying locks (can slow you or your pursuers down depending on how you time them), canal economics (keep yourself refuelled at chandleries as you pass them) and staying on top of repairs (your boat will need fixing every so often. Either stop and deal with repairs as they come, or keep going forwards until they build up and bring you to a complete halt). 

##### Idea 2: Robot Platformer
[Paper Prototype](https://youtube.com/shorts/YePgMwbQUTk?si=Ox-Gx0sC_hZafTdL)

Platformer style game where you are an Android in the year 2442. An evil conglomerate has stolen parts from you and your mission is to get these back before it's too late and you become obsolete. Along the way you have to go through levels and solve small puzzles and problems to progress. Problems to deal with include lasers, trap doors, and traps. The tools at your disposal include jet packs, teleportation and hacking. These are upgrades that you get as you find the parts and progress through the levels.


### Requirements 

- 15% ~750 words
- Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop?

[Game Requirements - stakeholders, epics, user stories and acceptance criteria](https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-14/blob/main/Requirements/GameRequirements.txt)

[Testing Session feedback on game requirements - positive feedback, confusing aspects and potential improvements to concept](https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-14/blob/main/Requirements/TestingSessionFeedback.md)

#### Stakeholders

- Markers
- Developers (us)
- Prospective gamers - friends and family
- Prospective gamers - testers (at testathons)
- Prospective gamers - boaters/enthusiasts
- Prospective gamers - other;

#### Epics

| Stakeholder | Epic |
|---|---|
| Markers | As markers, we want a game that is based around unique mechanics to demonstrate the developers' capabilities.|
| Developers | As developers, we want a game that is easily implementable so that we can complete it within the timeframe.|
|Prospective gamers - friends and family| As friends and family, we want a game that is intutive so that it is easy for casual gamers or new gamers to play.|
|Prospective gamers - testers| As testers, we want a game that is stable so that it will not crash even as we try to break it. |
|Prospective gamers - boaters/enthusiasts| As boaters/enthusiasts, we want a game that captures the tone and feel of the canals.|
|Prospective gamers - other| As prospective gamers, we want a game that is fun to play.|

#### User stories

| Stakeholder | User story | Acceptance crteria |
|---|---|---|
| Markers |As markers, we want the challenge of overcoming map hazards to synergize with damage and pursuit so it can be assessed as a cohesive test of player strategy and thus a "twist".|Given control over the boat avatar and awareness of hazards and the pursuer, when I employ a clear strategy based on game mechanics, I should be able to complete the game.|
| Developers |As developers, we want modular game design based around  the interactions between objects so that they can be worked on seperately and we can thus divide tasks among our team members.|Given that we are assigned individual objects and mechanics to work on, when we merge branches, these mechanics should interact with minimal refactoring.| 
|Prospective gamers - friends and family|As a friend or family of the developers, I want a WASD or arrow-key control system so that I can navigate the boat.|Acceptance Criteria: Given that I have access to a keyboard while playing the game, when I press a button to move the boat avatar, the on-screen boat should move in an expected way.|
|Prospective gamers - friends and family|As a friend or family of the developers, I want instructions so that I can play the game.|Given that I have started up the game myself and seen the loading/introductory screen, when I start gameplay, I should not be confused as to controls or aims.|
|Prospective gamers - testers|As testers, we want the game to have gone through internal testing process so that breaking it will pose a challenge to us.|Given that the game has been submitted to a testathon, when a tester attempts to break it, it should not break.|
|Prospective gamers - boaters/enthusiasts|As a boating enthusiast I want a map that is interestingly shaped to provide a sense of exploration.|Given some familiarity with the English countryside, while playing the game, I should be able to recognise locks, winding holes and fields.|
|Prospective gamers - boaters/enthusiasts|As a boating enthusiast, I want the mechanics to feel verasimilitudinous to boat life.|Given that this avatar is a boat, when the player moves it, it should make the motions of a vessel that turns and advances rather than strafing.|
|Prospective gamers - other|As a player of the game I want a map I can navigate in order to encounter structured challenges.|Given that I have been playing the game for a certain amount of time, when I overcome a level hazard it should have required a greater mastery of the game's mechanics than overcoming a challenge when having played the game for less time.|
|Prospective gamers - other|As a player of the game I want to encounter locks as a map hazard so that there is challenge|Given that locks slow down both the player avatar and the pursuer, when I encounter one on the map, successful employment of other game mechanics should determine whether I am able to pass it or whether it causes me to lose the game.|
|Prospective gamers - other|As a player of the game I want to track and address damage to the boat so that there is a challenge|Given that my boat has taken damage, when I need to strategize in order to beat the game, I should be able to see the damage level and have some option to repair it.|
|Prospective gamers - other|As a player of the game I want to be pursued by an opponent with an increasing skill/power/speed level to keep the challenge consistently fresh.|Given that the game has been played for some time, when the enemy AI moves, it should be operating with a distinct AI algorithm from the starting AI that accounts for more player behaviours.| 
|Prospective gamers - other|As a player of the game I want a map that contains routes and hazards to reward strategic thinking|Given that the player has progressed beyond the very opening stages of the game, when the player makes a choice to move the boat in a particular direction, this should be an enactment of a player strategy rather than progression down a linear route.|
|Prospective gamers - other|As a plyaer of the game I want it to have a small narrative component to provide context.|Given that I have watched the game's introduction, when I see the enemy avatar approach, I should be able to say why they are chasing me and what the stakes are for my hypothetical player character.|


### Requirements Reflection
Initially, for certain cases, we had difficulty distinguishing between the Initiative, Epic, and User Story, as each one requires a different level of specificity -- a level which may vary between different teams due to factors such as the length of their sprints. However, we quickly established that our sprints will be short (not more than one week), and that the categories should be thought of as follows:

(1) **Initiative** = largest overview/goal; it is made up of several Epics.

(2) **Epic** = more narrow scope than an Initiative but large enough that it takes several sprints to complete; it is made up of several user stories.

(3) **User Story** = even more specific than an Epic and must be achievable within a single sprint.

(4) **Acceptance Criteria** = a pre-determined set of expectations/outcomes which is retrospectively measured against a specific user story, to ensure that what was promised has been fulfilled.

Another helpful lesson which Ruzanna mentioned to us is that if a particular Acceptance Criteria depends on something else that is not in the corresponding story, it could mean that it should be broken down into multiple stories. This way, each story can be developed independently, and the epic can be delivered incrementally. This modularity is important because development could otherwise become inefficient.

When establishing the requirements in the specific context of our game, we quickly realised the utility of Agile development, as it can be difficult to know upfront what all the requirements will be. We focused on prioritising the most important aspects of the game. For example, developing fluid and intuitive movement for the boat which the user controls, and not worrying yet about less pressing nice-to-have features like sound effects. As a team, we find the prioritisation matrix below to be a useful tool and reminder of what to work on next.

- System architecture. Class diagrams, behavioural diagrams.

#### UML Class Diagram

This is my first stab at a class diagram. We can update it once we've consolidated the core features and/or planned which features to implement next. For now, it's just a rough and ready template.

### Evaluation

- 15% ~750 words

#### Qualitative Evaluation

##### 'Thinking Aloud' Evaluation

We have split our evaluation into three sections â€“ the first two being feedback from the user, and the last being our teamâ€™s analysis of the feedback: 
(1) Constructive Criticism; (2) Positives; (3) Analysis, based on the userâ€™s feedback.

**(1) Constructive Criticism**
- Corners difficult to navigate with current movement mechanics. Glitches occur on corner collisions; and too much bounce when colliding with the walls of the canals.
- Pursuer too fast and/or starts too close to the Player.
- The player did not feel in direct control of the movement; there is a learning curve to navigate the corners without crashing and being caught by the pursuer.
- Repair function not very intuitive and too slow to repair.
- Health bar too small; bigger bar would be easier to notice.
- More small bends would be good, not just straight lines.
- How do you win the game? Unclear objective.

**(2) Positives**
- Map shape was interesting because of the sharp corners.
- Original game idea; never played a game like it before.
- User liked the top-down birds eye view as they could see the entire map on the screen and therefore see upcoming corners.
- Aesthetics (boats and water texture) received compliments. 

**(3) Analysis**
- We need to improve collision detection between the player and canal walls. Collisions occur when they should not; being close to the corner as you go around it, but not actually touching the wall, may register as a collision and bounce the player back. This has a big impact on the userâ€™s experience and is therefore high priority.
- We should consider reducing the amount which the player bounces away from the wall when they collide.
- A simple tutorial on the controls and objective(s) of the game would make the experience more enjoyable and reduce the learning curve.
- We could also add sound to collisions and when health goes down to, for example, 50%, to make the game more immersive and make it clearer to the player that they are losing health. The tutorial would also help with this.
- We should consider adding multiple levels with varying skill levels for the AI pursuer, so that the player has a chance to get used to the game with a slower pursuer and once they get a feel for the movement of the boat they can progress and have a faster pursuer chasing them. Scaling the difficulty can help us cater to inexperienced and seasoned gamers alike.
- To produce a more difficult level, we can change the camera to scroll the map into view instead of showing the entire map on the screen; not seeing upcoming corners will make it more difficult.



##### Heuristic Evaluation

| Interface     | Issue         | Heuristics    |Frequency (0-4)| Impact (0-4)  |Persistence (0-4)| Severity (0-4)|
| ------------- |-------------  | ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| Repairs & visuals | The mechanic of the boat freezing after a repair requires you to start moving again but this is not visually indicated | Visibility of system status | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Canal | Enemy boat goes through walls instead of colliding | Error prevention | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 
| Controls | It is hard to turn on sharp corners, especially when boat is at speed | User control and freedom | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 |
| Canal | Invisible walls mean turning is not always possible but this is not evident to the player | Error prevention | 2 | 3 | 1 | 2 |
| Instructions | It is not immediately obvious how to turn or use the repair. Need clear instructions before the game starts | Help and documentation | 0 | 3 | 1 | 2 |

The feedback from our heuristic evaluation highlighted several usability issues across different components of our game. Broadly, we found that some players struggled with unclear instructions, particularly for turning and repairs, which we plan to address with clearer on-screen prompts and tutorials. We also noted issues with invisible walls affecting turning, alongside difficulty navigating sharp corners at high speeds. Both issues fall under error prevention and user control, suggesting the need for improved visual cues and better control mechanics. To tackle these we will refine the control system and attempt to debug issues with collisions.

#### Quantitative Evaluation

##### System Useability Survey (SUS)

| SUS Question | Average SUS Score (Easy) | Average SUS Level (Difficult) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 65 | 47.5 |
| 2 |	55 | 65 |
| 3	| 80 | 72.5 |
| 4	| 85 | 72.5 |
| 5	| 65 | 62.5 |
| 6	| 82.5 | 77.5 |
| 7	| 55 | 35 |
| 8	| 90 | 82.5 |
| 9	| 57.5 | 65 |
| 10 |87.5 | 80 |
| AVERAGE | 72.25 | 66 |

Upon applying the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test on the data, a W-statistic of 11.5 was obtained. For n = 10 and at a significance level of 0.05, this  value is greater than the critical value of 8, indicating a statistically significant difference in the useability scores between the two levels.

A more granular analysis of the raw data showed that particularly large contributions to the useability score came from Questions 4, 7, and 10 for both levels. These questions are:
- I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system. (4)
- I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly. (7)
- I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system. (10)

Question 2 also made a fairly large contribution to the SUS for the easy level:
- I found the system unnecessarily complex. (2)

These large contributions indicate that currently the useability (or lack thereof) of the system may be dominated by the lack of instruction and information provided to the player when they start the game. We (the developers) needed to tell them quite a lot of information before they could start, and most of the testers took a few moments to get to grips with the controls. However, the large contribution from Question 7 (I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly) suggests that once they have absorbed and understood how to use the system, they find it easy to use. 

Based on this, we can conclude that there is a satisfactorily significant difference between the different levels of the game. However, considerable gains in useability for both levels could be achieved by implementing methods to provide more information to the user about how to play the game and use the controls at the outset, for example, text explanations and/or tutorials.
