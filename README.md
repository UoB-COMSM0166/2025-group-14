## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel?

#### Game ideas

##### Idea 1: Canal chase game
[Paper Prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piU6QgTMxiM)

Top down lightly humorous chase game where you, on a canalboat, must flee a pursuing canalboat, across a top-down map. In addition to dodging your pursuerâ€™s AI, you must master such mechanics as: rounding tight corners (ideally overcoming some very basic physics challenges; this is a secondary priority to AI pursuit mechanics), filling and emptying locks (can slow you or your pursuers down depending on how you time them), canal economics (keep yourself refuelled at chandleries as you pass them) and staying on top of repairs (your boat will need fixing every so often. Either stop and deal with repairs as they come, or keep going forwards until they build up and bring you to a complete halt). 

##### Idea 2: Robot Platformer
[Paper Prototype](https://youtube.com/shorts/YePgMwbQUTk?si=Ox-Gx0sC_hZafTdL)

Platformer style game where you are an Android in the year 2442. An evil conglomerate has stolen parts from you and your mission is to get these back before it's too late and you become obsolete. Along the way you have to go through levels and solve small puzzles and problems to progress. Problems to deal with include lasers, trap doors, and traps. The tools at your disposal include jet packs, teleportation and hacking. These are upgrades that you get as you find the parts and progress through the levels.


### Requirements 

- 15% ~750 words
- Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop?

#### Requirements Reflection
Initially, for certain cases, we had difficulty distinguishing between the Initiative, Epic, and User Story, as each one requires a different level of specificity -- a level which may vary between different teams due to factors such as the length of their sprints. However, we quickly established that our sprints will be short (not more than one week), and that the categories should be thought of as follows:

(1) **Initiative** = largest overview/goal; it is made up of several Epics.

(2) **Epic** = more narrow scope than an Initiative but large enough that it takes several sprints to complete; it is made up of several user stories.

(3) **User Story** = even more specific than an Epic and must be achievable within a single sprint.

(4) **Acceptance Criteria** = a pre-determined set of expectations/outcomes which is retrospectively measured against a specific user story, to ensure that what was promised has been fulfilled.

Another helpful lesson which Ruzanna mentioned to us is that if a particular Acceptance Criteria depends on something else that is not in the corresponding story, it could mean that it should be broken down into multiple stories. This way, each story can be developed independently, and the epic can be delivered incrementally. This modularity is important because development could otherwise become inefficient.

When establishing the requirements in the specific context of our game, we quickly realised the utility of Agile development, as it can be difficult to know upfront what all the requirements will be. We focused on prioritising the most important aspects of the game. For example, developing fluid and intuitive movement for the boat which the user controls, and not worrying yet about less pressing nice-to-have features like sound effects. As a team, we find the prioritisation matrix below to be a useful tool and reminder of what to work on next.

### Design

- 15% ~750 words 
- System architecture. Class diagrams, behavioural diagrams. 

### Implementation

- 15% ~750 words

- Describe implementation of your game, in particular highlighting the three areas of challenge in developing your game. 

### Evaluation

- 15% ~750 words

- One qualitative evaluation (your choice) 

- One quantitative evaluation (of your choice) 

- Description of how code was tested. 

### Process 

- 15% ~750 words

- Teamwork. How did you work together, what tools did you use. Did you have team roles? Reflection on how you worked together. 

### Conclusion

- 10% ~500 words

- Reflect on project as a whole. Lessons learned. Reflect on challenges. Future work. 

### Contribution Statement

- Provide a table of everyone's contribution, which may be used to weight individual grades. We expect that the contribution will be split evenly across team-members in most cases. Let us know as soon as possible if there are any issues with teamwork as soon as they are apparent. 

### Additional Marks

You can delete this section in your own repo, it's just here for information. in addition to the marks above, we will be marking you on the following two points:

- **Quality** of report writing, presentation, use of figures and visual material (5%) 
  - Please write in a clear concise manner suitable for an interested layperson. Write as if this repo was publicly available.

- **Documentation** of code (5%)

  - Is your repo clearly organised? 
  - Is code well commented throughout?
