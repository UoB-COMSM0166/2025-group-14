*** 1. game mechanics
**** stage one (high importance)
1. up down left right (low effort)
2. lake with sides we cannot cross (mid effort)
3. pursuer (high effort)
4. movement mechanics (high effort)
**** stage two (high effort)
4. aesthetics of game
5. damage taken
6. gates opening/ closing
7. refueling 

*** 2. should we start on game development?
    yes
    
** actions
**** implement first point of game mechanics this week
**** drinks
** next meeting
Here we'll decide actions for this week
* 04/02/2025
** topics
1. is done
moving onto 2.

We want the camera to follow
** actions
*** tasks
**** research and prototyping
- movement team: dan and leon
- lake team: leah and casey
- pursuer team: polly and adam
*** adam doing kanban
*** create git branches
- each feature has it's own branch
- each person has their own branch


* 11/02/2025
** topics
*** catch up on progress
**** research and prototyping
- movement team: dan and leon
  95%
- lake team: leah and casey
  80% done
- pursuer team: polly and adam
  95%
  
*** discussion on what to merge and how
- merge movement with pursuer then after this merge lake
- meetup to merge in 2 parts
*** modularising the code (seperate files for seperate features)
- look at polly's branch for cleaning up the repo
** next steps
this week:
    1. one class for each feature
    2. meetup with leah
    3. pursuer and movement team merging to main
    4. lake to main
next week:
    - other stuff
      
* 13/02/2025
** topics
*** merging process
- going with daniels version for movement team
- daniel changing variable names
*** sprint for next week
- Leah:
  lakes development, locks
- Casey:
  camera following and levels
- Polly:
  damage
- Adam:
  path finding ability of pursuer
- Dan:
  fuel system
- Leon:

Teams meeting, all going well
- Daniel and Leah to refocus on collision mechanics
* 21/02/2025
- Leon's boats are looking great. Working on filling in lake artwork
- Leah and Daniel have been working on making sure the boat behaves properly when hitting sides
- Casey's level generation is going ok
- Adam's path finding pursuer is coming along nicely
** next steps
- start merging all features and integrating to main
* 25/02/2025
** topics
- catch up!
** notes
- continuing: Casey, Polly, Leah
- Adam: pursuers with flat levels
- Leah: continuing canal work
***
- Leon and Daniel: TBC
* 06/03/2025
** topics
- catch up
** notes
- Polly has updated the repo with the quantitative evaluation. Leon too
- Polly has been improving her features
- Leah making progress on the forks. She'll next be working on some issues
- perhaps we can look into p5.play or other JS physics libraries
- leon working on main menu
- perhaps we can think about integrating more features to help players with the usability of the game
- adam trying to work out pursuer following the player with new maps

* 25/03/2025
Long hiatus due to Java assignment related concerns
** topics
Daniel has done a go at using p5.play to rewrite some of the code over the weekend.
Leah is going through it
*** p5.play refactor
everyone is on board with this
refactoring rather than restructuring
** actions
going to all try and grok p5 play and think about how we'll go about refactoring for the next meeting
